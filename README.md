ECE1778 A3
==========

iOS app following the requirements of ECE1778 assignment 3.

Requirements
------------
Write an iOS application that, in response to being shaken, takes a picture 1 second after the shaking stops, and also records the GPS location at the same time. Each location should be stored in a growing list; when the user touches the list item, your application should display the picture taken at that location. The list should be maintained over 2 separate invocations of the app, and it should be possible to delete a list item, which would remove the corresponding image in the file system.

To test this application, you will have to use an actual mobile device, and so may need to borrow one of the Huawei devices available for this.
